Hey, so switching things up with this and trying out freeCodeCamp's program, and I have to say thus far having a really fun time with it.

So with this first project after going through some exercises to test my base HTML & CSS abilites I was tasked with designing a Survey Form.

Now I will go ahead and say it's very bare bones, but a first start into something I hope to have the skill to turn into something really amazing later on in life, but until that experience is aquired here is what I got for now. 

* Oh & side note I know I have another webpage on here for Codecademy, the only differnece between the two is that I had a reference to model after that I had to recreate with the codecademy one, & with this one it was more of a come up with your own thing as opposed to mirrioring what was given to me.*
