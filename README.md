Hey, so switching things up with this and trying out freeCodeCamp's program, and I have to say thus far having a really fun time with it.

So with this first project after going through som exercise to test my base HTML & CSS abilites I was tasked with designing a Survey Form.

Now i will go adhead and say it is very bare bones but a first start into something I hope to have the skill to turn into something really amazing later on in life, but utnil that experience is aquired here is what I got for now. 

Oh and side note I know i have another webpage on here for Codecademy, the only differnece between the two is that I had a reference to model after that I had to recreated with that one and this one was more of a come up with your own thing as opposed to mirrioring what was given to me.
